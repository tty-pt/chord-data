Of The Voice

A E/G# F#m E  
1. From the heights, a Voice declared,
D A/C# Bm7 E7  
"You're not alone, though life feels bare. 
F#m C#m D A/C#  
Within you dwells creation's flame,  
Bm7 E A E   
The silent spark that shapes a name."
F#m D A/C# E  
"You claim the world is void and blind, 
Bm7 E A E  
But truth resides within your mind.  
D E F#m C#m
Where thought exists, so does the will,  
D A/C# Bm7 E
And freedom drives the spirit still."

Em7 D Gmaj7 Cmaj7
C: Timeless Voice, You call my name,  
Am7 D7 G Bm7  
Through the echoes, through the flame.  
Cmaj7 G D Am7  
Stars may fade, but You remain,
D7 Em Cmaj7 G
The endless light that breaks the chain.

2. "Even in shadows, embers glow, | Life persists where none may know.  
A grain of sand, a distant star, | Both reflect the light we are."
"You say the river carries you, | But rivers flow with choice in view.  
From stream to sea, they chart their course, | And choose to draw from freedomâ€™s source."
Even the dry tree waits for spring,
Life restored, a timeless ring.
What seems lost can still arise,
Hope endures beneath the skies.

C: Eternal Voice, a guiding star,  
The light that leads us near and far.  
Through endless time, Your truth remains,  
A love that soothes, a voice that reigns.
Em7 D Gmaj7 Cmaj7
You calm the waves, You still the storm,
Am7 D7 Em9 Bm7
Your presence guides where hearts are warm.
Gmaj7 D Cmaj7 G
In You we rest, no fear, no pain,
Cmaj7 D7 G
Forever Yours, in love we reign.
