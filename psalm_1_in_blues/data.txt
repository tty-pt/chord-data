 Gm                                             C Gm
1. Blessed is the man who walks not in the dark.
Don't sit with the wicked don't stand where they bark
      A#                 C                    Gm
But delights in the word:  both day and night.
       A#                C                 Gm
Like a tree by the river, he stands upright.

He's like a tree roots diggin' deep.
In season he bears what the faithful reap.
Leaves don't wither, wigs don't shake.
The Lord knows the road the righteous takes.

2. But the wicket, oh, they're dust in the air.
Like shaff in the wind, they vanish somewhere.
They won't stand in judgement when truth appears.
                           F          C    Gm
They chose their path, but not their fears.

    D#                 Gm
The Lord watches every step I thread.
D#                Gm
Guards the humble raises the dead.
        A#                  C
But the road of the wicked, fades and bends.
      D
While grace rows on, without no end.

   C                       Gm
So I'll keep singuing that blessed tune.
A#                 F            C D
 Planted in mercy, pruned by tru--uth.

Gm
