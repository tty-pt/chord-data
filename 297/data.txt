Of The Voice

A E/G# F#m E | D A/C# Bm7 E7  
1. From the heights, a Voice declared,
"You're not alone, though life feels bare. 
F#m C#m D A/C# | Bm7 E A E
Within you dwells creation's flame,  
The silent spark that shapes a name."
F#m D A/C# E | Bm7 E A E
"You claim the world is void and blind, 
But truth resides within your mind.  
D E F#m C#m | D A/C# Bm7 E
Where thought exists, so does the will,  
And freedom drives the spirit still."

Em7 D Gmaj7 Cmaj7 |1 Am7 D7 G Bm7 |2 Am7 Cmaj7 D7 G
Timeless Voice, A beacon bright
Guiding hearts through endless night.
Where there's choice there's life anew.
A path of light that leads to you.

2. "Even in shadows, embers glow, | Life persists where none may know.  
A grain of sand, a distant star, | Both reflect the light we are."
"You say the river carries you, | But rivers flow with choice in view.  
From stream to sea, they chart their course, | And choose to draw from freedomâ€™s source."

3. The dry tree holds a secret still, | thought lifeless now it bends to will
New shoots arise when none expect | In barren soil life resurrects.
Shadows veil but can't obscure. | The truth that's bright and ever pure.
Life's light remains, though veiled and dim. | It shines within, where hope begins.

C: Eternal Voice, a guiding star,  
The light that leads us near and far.  
Through endless time, Your truth remains,  
A love that soothes, a voice that reigns.
Em7 D Gmaj7 Cmaj7
You calm the waves, You still the storm,
Am7 D7 Em9 Bm7
Your presence guides where hearts are warm.
Gmaj7 D Cmaj7 G
In You we rest, no fear, no pain,
Cmaj7 D7 G
Forever Yours, in love we reign.
